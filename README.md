NFL Draft Sim done with ASP.NET MVC server side and AngularJS client side.

This project was a early attempt. It lives again and in a slightly more structured (if less complete) state at my [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/hhorne/draftbored) repo

You can see it live [here](http://draftbored.azurewebsites.net/)
